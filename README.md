A chat app to share your despair.

TODO:

Categorize chats in categories based on words (tags?).
Clicking on a user creates a chat with them.
Put in an admin user that mods the main feed.
Set a limit on number of users that appear on feed.
A map to connect with people nearby (actually stalking heh heh).
Some filters for names.
Option to switch from anonymous posting to username.
Option for a user profile and user photo.

BUGS:

Social media logins via Meteor accounts package do not properly show username.
Error pops when deleting an entry.
CSS is still janky.
